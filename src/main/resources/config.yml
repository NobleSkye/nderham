# ScorePack Main Configuration
# 
# This is the main configuration file for ScorePack.
# To configure scoreboard-based resource packs, create separate YAML files
# named after your scoreboard objectives (e.g., level.yml, rank.yml, coins.yml)
#
# For detailed documentation, see README.md

# Plugin settings
plugin:
  name: "ScorePack"
  version: "1.0.0"
  
# Configuration information
config:
  # Each YAML file in the plugin directory (except config.yml) represents
  # a scoreboard objective configuration
  # 
  # Example files:
  # - level.yml     -> monitors "level" scoreboard objective
  # - rank.yml      -> monitors "rank" scoreboard objective  
  # - coins.yml     -> monitors "coins" scoreboard objective
  #
  # See the example files (level.yml, rank.yml) for the proper structure
  
# Notes:
# - Resource packs are applied when a player's score matches a configured value
# - SHA-256 hashes are optional but recommended for security
# - Use /scorepack reload to reload configurations without restarting the server
# - Use /scorepack info to see loaded objectives
